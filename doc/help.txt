Type `connect <character-name> <password>'     to connect to your character, 
     `connect Guest'     to connect to a guest character,
     `create'            to see how to get a character of your own,
     `@who'              just to see who's logged in right now,
     `@uptime'           to see how long the server has been running,
     `@version'          to see what version of the server we're running, or
     `@quit'             to disconnect, either now or later.

For example, `connect Munchkin frebblebit' would connect to the character
`Munchkin' if `frebblebit' were the right password.

After you've connected, type
     `help'              for more documentation.
